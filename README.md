# YahtzeeGame

This is a simple 2 player Yahtzee game. It should mostly be working but it is a little buggy.

I created this game as a practice for using C# and Windows Forms. It was also the first time I was using C# and a long time since I have used OOP. Although, I knew some OOP before starting this, I didn't really use any of that. This project was more so about learning WIndows Forms and getting used to using Visual Studio.
